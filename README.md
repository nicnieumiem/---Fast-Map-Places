It contains solutions to all required and extra tasks.

This application fetches most popular flickr photo spots, sorts them according to country, allows to display selected photos using standard table view or map view. Latest photos viewed are cached, threads are used to perform non-ui (photos/places fetching,caching) related work. More info can be found in assignment description :
